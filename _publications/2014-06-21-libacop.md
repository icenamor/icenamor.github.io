This document describes two planning portfolios developed
for the Learning Track of IPC-2014 (International
Planning Competition). The Learning Instance-Based
Configured Portfolios are based on predictive models
learnt with training instances gathered from previous
executions of the base planners. For solving new planning
problems, the portfolios select a group of planners
using the predictions of the learnt models. Specifically,
LIBACOP uses a classification model to select potential
planners assigning the same execution time to each
of them. LIBACOP2 uses the same classification model
and, in addition, a regression model to predict the time
for each planner
