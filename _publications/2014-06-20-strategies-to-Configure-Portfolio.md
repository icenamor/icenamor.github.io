The portfolios of planners have arised as a great idea
in automated planning. Their main challenge is how to
combine portfolio components, i.e. the base planners.
The most extended solution is the static combination of
the planners, where the same configuration is used for
all the problems in all the domains. This solution is not
very flexible, and it might be less efficient than a particular
combination of planners for every single problem.
In the middle, a portfolio could be configured for a specific
domain, so all the problems in such domains are
solved with the same portfolio configuration. For this
reason, we analyze different ways to configure a portfolio
for each problem and create some strategies and
techniques to exploit the planning portfolios.
