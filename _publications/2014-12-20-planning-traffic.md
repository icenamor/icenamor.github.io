Local authorities that manage traffic-related issues in
urban areas have to optimise the use of available resources,
in order to minimise congestion and delays.
In this context, Automated Planning and Scheduling
can be fruitfully exploited, in order to provide dynamic
plans that help managing the urban road network.
In this paper we provide a review of existing planning
and scheduling approaches that have been designed for
dealing with different aspects of traffic management,
with the aim of gaining insights on the limits of current
applications, and highlighting the open challenges.
