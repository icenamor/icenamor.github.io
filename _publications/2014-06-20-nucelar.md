In this document we describe the techniques used to
configure NuCeLaR, a sequential portfolio submitted
and adapted to the three deterministic sequential tracks
of the International Planning Competition 2014: sequential
optimal, sequential satisficing and sequential
multi-core. This portfolio has been configured using
the combination of Machine Learning techniques and
Mixed-Integer Programming.
