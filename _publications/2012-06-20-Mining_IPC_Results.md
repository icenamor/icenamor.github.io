The International Planning Competition (IPC) offers a wonderful
scope to evaluate and compare different planning approaches
and specific planner implementations in benchmark
domains. In IPC 2011, the software generated for the competition
permits to obtain a lot of data about the execution of
all the planners in the different tracks in a simple way, which
permits its recovery and use. In this work, we propose to analyze
such data from a Data Mining (DM) perspective, including
additional features which can be useful for the analysis.
In such a way, we are able to construct models of the results
obtained, allowing us to make additional analysis to the ones
performed by the organizers. In this work, we report some
initial analysis after constructing classification and regression
models for the sequential satisficing and optimal track
