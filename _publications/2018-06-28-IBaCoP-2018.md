This manuscript describes the IBaCoP family of planning
portfolios submitted to the International Planning Competition
2018. Our portfolios are improved versions of the planners
submitted to the last IPC-2014. IBaCoP-2018 is configured
following a Pareto efficiency approach for selecting
planners and then giving the same execution time for the selected
planners. IBaCoP2-2018 decides for each problem the
sub-set of planners to use. This decision is based on predictive
models trained with domain/problems from previous IPCs.
Both 2018 portfolios compete in the sequential satisficing and
agile tracks.
