This manuscript describes several planning portfolios
that use the same base planners. Our Instance Based
Configured Portfolios follow two different strategies.
IBaCoP is configured a priori following a Pareto efficiency
approach to select a sub-set of planners (baseline
strategy), which receive the same execution time for all
planning problems. On the contrary, IBaCoP2 decides
for each problem the sub-set of planners to use. Such decisions
are based on predictive models learnt also with
training instances gathered from previous executions of
the base planners. Both portfolios compete in the sequential
satisficing, agile and multi-core tracks
