Empirical performance models play an important role in the
development of planning portfolios that make a per-domain
or per-problem configuration of its search components. Even
though such portfolios have shown their power when compared
to other systems in current benchmarks, there is no
clear evidence that they are capable to differentiate problems
(instances) having similar input properties (in terms of objects,
goals, etc.) but fairly different runtime for a given planner.
In this paper we present a study of empirical performance
models that are trained using problems having the same configuration,
with the objective of guiding the models to recognize
the underlying differences existing among homogeneous
problems. In addition we propose a set of new features
that boost the prediction capabilities under such scenarios.
The results show that the learned models clearly performed
over random classifiers, which reinforces the hypothesis that
the selection of planners can be done on a per-instance basis
when configuring a portfolio.
