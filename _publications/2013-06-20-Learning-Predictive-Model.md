One of the latest advances for solving classical planning problems
is the development of new approaches such as portfolios
of planners. In a portfolio, different base planners are run
sequentially to solve a problem. Therefore, the main challenge
of a portfolio planner is to define what base planners
to run, in what order, and for how long. This configuration
can be created manually or automatically, for instance, using
machine learning techniques. In this work, a dynamic portfolio
planner is described which, opposite to previous portfolio
planners, is able to adapt itself to every new problem. The
portfolio automatically selects the planners and the time according
to predictive models. These models estimate whether
a base planner will be able to solve the problem and, if so,
how long it will take. The predictive models are created with
machine learning techniques, using the data of the last International
Planning Competition (IPC). Prediction capability of
the models depend on the features extracted from the IPC results
for each problem. In this work, we use a group of features
extracted from the SAS+ formulation of such problems.
We define different portfolio strategies, and we show that the
resulting portfolios provide an improvement when compared
not only with the winning planner of the last competition
(LAMA), but also with less informed portfolio strategies.
