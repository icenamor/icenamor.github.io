IBaCoP2 is a portfolio auto configurable with a classification
model. This portfolio is an evolution of IBaCoP, since
it takes as base planners, the planners selected by IBaCoP.
However, IBaCoP2 performs a second planner selection using
predictive models. These models are the result of learning
processes and predict the behaviour of the planners in
future problems, i.e. whether they will be able to solve the
problems or not. The planners with higher confidence are selected
and ordered following such confidence. Then, running
time is divided uniformly among them
