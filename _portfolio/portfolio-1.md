title: "IBaCoP (IPC-2014)"
excerpt: "IBaCoP is the result of applying the Pareto efficiency
technique (Censor 1977) to select a sub-set of planners from
the planners in sequential satisficing track plus LPG-td. We
select the planners that dominates all others in at least one
domain (from a set of training domains), taking into account
quality and time. We assign the same running time for all
selected planners<br/>"
