Description
----------------------------
The objective of this course is to introduce students to the basic concepts of statistical learning, understanding as such the series of techniques that allow the description and modeling of complex data sets and the automatic procedures framed under the category of "data mining", also known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases, KDD, which serve to extract relevant and generally implicit and unknown information from massive data, through mechanisms that detect patterns and regularities in such data and that can be used to predict responses to new situations, detect the key fields that determine the characteristics of the problem, perform segmentations of automatically, launch forecasts, detect exceptions, propose scenarios; in short, anticipate the future objectively and based on real data.
