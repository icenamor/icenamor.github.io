About Me

I am a technology leader with a PhD[^2] in Artificial Intelligence and over a decade of experience at the intersection of academic research and software engineering. My career spans both worlds: I’ve published research in automated planning and machine learning, and I’ve led cross-functional development teams in the private sector, delivering complex, high-impact systems.

Currently, I work as Head of Development at Xplain, a Swiss company that provides secure software solutions for public authorities. In this role, I manage multiple engineering teams covering backend, frontend, mobile, and database technologies. I am responsible for ensuring technical excellence, architectural decisions, delivery timelines, and team growth. I work closely with stakeholders to align technology with business goals, and I support strategic planning and innovation across the organization.

My academic foundation comes from Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, where I earned my PhD under the supervision of [Fernando Fernández](http://www.plg.inf.uc3m.es/~ffernand/)  and [Tomás de la Rosa](https://rocketreach.co/tomas-de-la-rosa-email_506789155). My research focused on AI planning, algorithm portfolios, and automated algorithm configuration, contributing to both domain-independent and domain-specific planning techniques[^1]. During my PhD, I collaborated with the PARK research group at the University of Huddersfield (UK), supported by the COST-ART initiative.

I am passionate about applying AI to real-world challenges, building strong, motivated technical teams, and driving continuous improvement in both technology and process. I also have teaching experience in Big Data and AI, and I value staying current through both formal learning and hands-on practice.

I'm always open to new challenges that combine strategic leadership with cutting-edge technology—especially in the fields of AI, data-driven systems, and product innovation.
