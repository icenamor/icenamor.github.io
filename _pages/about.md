I received my PhD[^2] in March 2017 from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid. My supervisors were [Fernando Fernández](http://www.plg.inf.uc3m.es/~ffernand/) and [Tomás de la Rosa](http://www.plg.inf.uc3m.es/~trosa/). I worked at the Planning and Learning Group [(PLG)](http://www.plg.inf.uc3m.es/) of the Universidad Carlos III  until June 2016[^1]. 
I moved to the private company where I am working now. 



During the PhD period, I did an internship  at University of Huddersfield of the PARK (Planning, Autonomy and Representation of Knowledge) research group, led by Lee McCluskey. I worked with Mauro Vallati and Lukas Chrpa on temporal planning. This internship  was supported by COST-ART program. 


My research was focused on the areas of automated planning and machine learning. In particular, I am interested in the portfolio approaches, automatic algorithm configuration, domain independent and domain-specific planning.
