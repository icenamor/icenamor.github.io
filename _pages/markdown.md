## PLICOGOR (2016)


Intelligent planning system for collective transport with optimised route generation
Goal Systems, acting as coordinator, and the Planning and Learning group, PLG, of the University Carlos III of Madrid, acting as partner, were awarded a grant to finance the implementation of the project "Intelligent planning system for public transport with optimised route generation".
This aid was granted by the Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness under the State Plan for Scientific and Technical Research and Innovation 2013-2016 Call for Challenges-Collaboration of the State Research, Development and Innovation Programme.
Oriented to the Challenges of Society.

This project consists of developing an optimal planning software tool (SW) that solves problems related to route generation.
One of the outputs of the application will be the optimal and automatic generation of supply routes with a demand input.
This demand can be for the collection of passengers/material from multiple origins to the same destination, or for the delivery of passengers/material from the same point of origin to various destinations.
The application will be useful for any sector of public transport, validating its performance in school transport.

## Autonomic Road Transport Support Systems (2014)

STSMs are exchange visits that enable Action participants to visit an institution in another COST country for research/collaboration purposes. 
These STSMs are particularly intended for young researchers (e.g., Ph.D. students and persons that fall within the category of early stage researchers), but other persons are also eligible to apply. Each Action has budget for a limited number of STSMs and these are approved by the MC through a competitive evaluation process.
I investigated the fruitfulness of exploiting Automated Planning techniques in
the Traffic control framework. Some models of real-world traffic have been used
in the last ''International Planning Competition'' run by staff at Huddersfield
for testing planners performance within the Automated Planning community.
