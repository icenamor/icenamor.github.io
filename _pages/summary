I received my PhD in March 2017 from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid, where I were also research and teaching assistant from 2012 at the Planning and Learning Group. 
My research was focused in the intersection of two artificial intelligence areas: automated planning and machine learning. In particular, I am interested in portfolio approaches and automatic algorithm configuration. My dissertation “Creating Planning Portfolios with Predictive Models” obtained four awards: three in the international planning competition (2014 and 2018) and the Ph.D Outstanding Thesis Award for the University Carlos III. During the PhD period, I also did an internship at University of Huddersfield of the PARK (Planning, Autonomy and Representation of Knowledge) research group, supported by COST-ART program. During my internship I worked on temporal planning, a variant of automated planning that takes time into account.

My current position consists in developing and supervising back-end projects, from its design and planning to the development and implementation of the software solutions. I am also the leader of the test team at the company.
